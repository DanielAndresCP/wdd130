    <h3>Flora across regions</h3>
    <p>
      Spanning over 4.300 km north to south, Chile's climate ranges from the world's driest desert in the north—the
      Atacama Desert—through a Mediterranean climate in the center, to an oceanic climate in the south. This varied
      climate is reflected on a beautiful and extensive flora all across the country.
