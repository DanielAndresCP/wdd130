    <h2>Daniel Andrés Concha Parra</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Daniel, I live in Chile, Región de Ñuble, Chillán Viejo. My hobbies include reading, doing
        crafts and programming. I am currently working on my family's bussiness, where I hope to apply the skills I
        learn while studying for my Software Development degree</p>
    <p>I was born in the covenant, so I have been a member of the church all my life. I am also preparing for serving a
        mission soon</p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is in Joshua 1:7, which says: 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou
        mayest observe to do according to all the law, [...] that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</p>
